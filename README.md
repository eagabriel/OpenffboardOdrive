# Odrive-Wheel — MKS XDrive Mini / ODESC V4.2 FFB Firmware

Custom firmware for ODrive v0.5.6 running on **MKS XDrive Mini** and
**ODESC V4.2** hardware (STM32F405-based clones of ODrive v3.6), adding
full **HID Force Feedback** support to use the motor as a sim racing wheel.

Based on:
- [ODrive Firmware v0.5.6](https://github.com/odriverobotics/ODrive) (motor control)
- [OpenFFBoard](https://github.com/Ultrawipf/OpenFFBoard) (FFB stack: HidFFB + EffectsCalculator)

Community contributions:
- [@aksc857-stack](https://github.com/aksc857-stack) — MT6835 21-bit SPI encoder: driver, threaded read path, atomic SPI arbiter guard, chip register access and CLI. Also velocity/acceleration from the encoder PLL, and the split of axis position invert from FFB torque invert
- [@TelksBr](https://github.com/TelksBr) — [ODrive-Wheel-Forge](https://github.com/TelksBr/ODrive-Wheel-Forge): USB HID PID compatibility fix suite and thermal telemetry
- [@simachines](https://github.com/simachines) — autogen tooling backup

## 🚀 Quick start

**Fastest path — in-browser Quick Start wizard.**

Open **<https://eagabriel.github.io/Odrive-Wheel/>** in Chrome/Edge,
connect the board via Web Serial, and follow the **Quick Start** tab —
a 13-step guided wizard that walks you from blank firmware all the way
to FFB responding in-game:

1. Flash firmware (DFU) → 2. Connect → 3. Erase old config → 4. Power &
protections (with **⚡ Set voltage** button — reads real `vbus_voltage`
and auto-configures over/undervoltage trips + regen ramp) → 5. Motor
config → 6. Encoder config → 7. Motor calibration → 8. Encoder offset →
9. Mark pre-calibrated & Save → 10. Configure Z (index pulse) → 11. FFB
config → 12. Test Spring → 13. Done.

Each step shows suggested values, links to the relevant config tab, and
decodes errors inline. UI is PT/EN.

## 📚 Guides

- **[Getting started (long-form)](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)** — first
  flash routes (`dfu-util` and browser DFU), minimum safe motor
  bring-up, Windows driver setup (Zadig).
- **[How torque control works](docs/TORQUE_CONTROL.md)** — deep dive
  into the FFB pipeline from Nm demand to motor current. Explains why
  `pos_gain` / `vel_gain` are inert in TORQUE mode.
- **[Tuning feeling (PT/EN)](docs/TUNING_FEELING.md)** — post-setup
  guide for shaping the FFB chain: gains, filters, end-stop, EQ.
- **[Building from source](docs/BUILDING.md)** — for when you want to
  modify the firmware, sync with upstream OpenFFBoard, or investigate a
  build issue.

## ✨ What you get

- **Full HID Force Feedback** via USB HID PID (DirectInput / Windows
  FFB). Effects: Constant, Spring, Damper, Friction, Inertia, Ramp,
  Periodic (Sine / Square / Triangle / Sawtooth). Nine PID
  compatibility fixes in v1.1.0 restore FFB in titles where it was
  silently broken (iRacing, AC, ACC, rFactor 2, Forza Motorsport, AMS2,
  BeamNG, DiRT Rally, F1, EA WRC).
  *Forza Horizon 5/6 uses Windows.Gaming.Input and still needs the
  community EmuWheel workaround — see Discord.*
- **Absolute encoders** — AS5047 (onboard MKS, 14-bit) and MagnTek
  MT6835 (21-bit, ODESC V4.2 SPI port) as first-class citizens.
  Incremental ABZ also supported.
- **3-band EQ** in the FFB Filters tab (WEIGHT / CHASSIS / ROAD, ±12
  dB), normalised on DC so cornering weight never changes as you tune.
- **Tuning profiles** in their own tab — save your setup per car class,
  switch in one click, share as JSON files.
- **1 kHz HID telemetry** — `vel_estimate`, `Iq_measured`,
  `torque_output`, `Vbus`, `Ibus`, `Ibrake` embedded in the input
  report at native rate, so tools and dashboards read the wheel without
  fighting the game for the serial channel.
- **iRacing PiP overlay** — always-on-top window with DC Bus, Wheel and
  live FFT panels, plus P_brake, P_motor and Clip OUT% indicators.
- **Performance Test suite** — J via median `Iq·τ/α`, coastdown for
  `b`/`τ`, frequency sweep with real Bode overlay on the filter chart.
- **In-browser DFU flasher** (WebUSB + DfuSe) with 📡 Fetch latest
  from GitHub — no `dfu-util` needed after the first flash. FFB
  settings survive the reflash (isolated flash sectors).

Full feature inventory and per-tab details live in the config tool
itself — every field has a hover tooltip.

## Flash the firmware

**Recommended path:** open the [HTML config tool](https://eagabriel.github.io/Odrive-Wheel/),
go to the **DFU Flash** tab, click **📡 Fetch latest from GitHub**, follow
the four buttons. Zero downloads on your side.

**First flash from a blank board** needs the STM32 DFU driver (`dfu-util`
CLI on Linux/macOS, Zadig one-time setup on Windows). Full walkthrough in
[docs/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Build from source

See **[docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md)** — CI, Windows and Linux
build routes, submodule notes, and how to sync with upstream OpenFFBoard.

## Licenses

- **ODrive Firmware** — MIT — `ODrive-fw-v0.5.6/`
- **OpenFFBoard** — GPLv3 — `OpenFFBoard-master/`
- **Our own code** (`Odrive-Wheel/src`, `inc`, `tools`) — GPLv3

Because GPL-licensed code from OpenFFBoard is included, the combined
work (compiled firmware) is distributed under **GPLv3**. See `LICENSE`
at the repo root and individual licenses in subdirectories.

## 💛 Support the project

A commercial direct-drive wheelbase with similar specs costs **R$3,000 to
R$10,000+**. Odrive-Wheel turns a generic BLDC motor + a $40 board into
something that competes with that — entirely open-source, no licensing,
no subscriptions, no firmware lock-ins.

Every hour invested here came out of nights and weekends. **If this
project saved you real money**, please consider supporting it so I can
keep adding features, fixing bugs, and answering questions:
